# Workflow Management Solutions for Public Health Bioinformatics
Theiagen Genomics repository for workshop resources, code templates, and exercise materails 

## Course Overview
This intermediate-level bioinformatics training workshop will provide conceptual and applied training for understanding and utilizing workflow management solutions (e.g. WDL and Nextflow) for interoperable, reproducible, and accessible genomic analysis.

## Length of Program
This workshop is designed as a virtual, 4-week series of live-lectures and hands-on exercises. For registered trainees, instructors will be made available for office hours and continued support throughout the duration of this course. All materials--slides, exercises, and recorded lectures--will be made available publicly accessible.

## Objectives
At the conclusion of this course, participants will be able to:
- Understand fundamental concepts, advantages, and disadvantages behind containerization and workflow management systems
- Analyze and assess WDL and Nextflow code bases 
- Utilize WDL and Nextflow workflow management systems to integrate multiple analytical modules into a single bioinformatics pipeline
- Publish custom workflows to the Dockstore pipeline repository for integration on the Terra.Bio web application
- Launch Nextflow pipeline on the Nextflow Tower platform

## Target Audience
This course is meant for public health bioinformatics scientists with experience accessing and interacting with open-source bioinformatics software through a command-line interface (CLI), version control systems such as Git, and familiarity with the concepts of containerized software systems such as Docker or Singularity. Registered Github accounts are encouraged for the completion of all planned exercises.
